[Conference Talk YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Lr9OGpkok&index=20&list=PL4eq2DPpyBbna_5fLPqOqensqSZpGf-hT)

### Abstract
Everyone wants a great pattern library to use within their company. Easy, right? Just code up some components and make sure all teams know where the repo is? Wrong. The library is your product, and your consumers are the entire company. There must be an iterative process to create, implement, version and release every feature – involving designers, developers, and documentation every step of the way.
In this talk, I’ll walk you through the process that will help you keep your styleguide current compatible with existing product features, and allow for smooth upgrades now and into the future.

### Details
This is for anyone who is interested in creating a design system / pattern library for his/her company or who has run into issues while implementing one in the past!

### Pitch
I've been working in Ember for a year and started helping to implement a pattern library within my company in the fall. Regardless of if you're brand new to programming or have been coding and working with designs for years, I'll show you how to implement and manage a working and iterative process for your company's design system. This process will help keep your pattern library iterative and current, compatible with existing product features, and allow for smooth upgrades now and into the future.
